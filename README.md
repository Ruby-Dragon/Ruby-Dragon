# std::cout << "Hello World!";

I'm *@Ruby-Dragon*, aspiring graphics programmer!

I'm still learning and most of my projects will go here as an archive of my progress.

My most used languages (as of right now) are C, C++, and C# for Godot, and I primairly use EndeavourOS Linux on all my machines.

#### If you are interested in collaboration, feel free to pull request away!

Currently learning: Godot, Shaders/Materials, and Blender!

Looking forward to joining some Open Source projects!

Check out my [website](https://ruby-dragon.github.io) if you want to read my rambling

### Please feel free to correct my mistakes, I would rather learn than just be ignorant. Even on my own repos, please tell me if I am doing something wrong (don't be mean about it though). Thank you!

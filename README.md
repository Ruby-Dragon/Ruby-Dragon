### Sup Y'all!

I'm *@Ruby-Dragon*, hopeful game dev!

I'm still learning, and most of my projects will go here. I want to make them opensource so others who are still learning can use them as examples.

My favorite language (as of right now) is C++, and I usually use Windows on my main machine, but have a secondary linux machine.

#### If you are interested in collaboration, feel free to pull request away!

Currently learning: Unreal (4 and 5), CPP, TrenchBroom, GLSL, Rust, Java, and drawing!

I usually use git through cli, and sometimes use integration in JetBrains IDEs. Looking forward to joining some Open Source projects!

### Please feel free to correct my mistakes, I would rather learn than just be ignorant. Even on my own repos, please tell me if I am doing something wrong (don't be mean about it tho). Thank you!
